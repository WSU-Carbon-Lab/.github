# Collins Research Group
### DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY

Welcome to the Collins Group at Washington State University. Our research is highly interdisciplinary, <img class = 'Logo' align = 'right'  src = 'https://github.com/WSU-Carbon-Lab/.github/assets/73567020/bd3dd1b8-3a42-468a-8def-969e2746b497'> straddling physics, materials science, electrical engineering and chemistry. We specialize in developing and using synchrotron X-ray techniques to investigate carbon-based materials designed to have novel optoelectronic properties. We strive to understand how interactions of organic molecules and polymers in aggregate and at interfaces govern the creation, transport, and annihilation of excited and charged states that result in power generation/storage, illumination, sensing and information processing.
